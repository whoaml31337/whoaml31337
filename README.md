  I am in the process of learning the basics of CI/CD using tools like GitHub Actions and Jenkins, working on setting up automated pipelines for building and testing applications.

- **Prometheus**:  
  I recently started learning Prometheus for monitoring application and infrastructure metrics. I am also studying how to use Grafana for data visualization and creating dashboards.
