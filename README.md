I am studying at School 21 and am eager to develop as a DevOps engineer. At the moment, I am actively learning DevOps tools and applying them in study projects.

### Мои навыки в процессе изучения / My Skills in Progress

  _In School 21, I have been working on projects in C for about 5 months. I am deepening my understanding of low-level programming and memory management._

- **Linux**:  
  _I am currently focusing on studying Linux, starting with basic system administration, learning the command line, and configuring the system. I am gradually introducing task automation using Bash scripts._

- **Docker**:  
  _I have started learning Docker for containerizing applications. At this stage, I am learning how to create and manage containers and use Docker Compose to run multiple services together._

- **Kubernetes**: 
  _I am just beginning to learn Kubernetes for container orchestration. I am studying how to deploy and manage clusters and work with Pods and other components._

- **CI/CD **:   
  _I am in the process of learning the basics of CI/CD using tools like GitHub Actions and Jenkins. I am working on setting up automated pipelines for building and testing applications._

- **Prometheus**: 
  _I recently started learning Prometheus for monitoring application and infrastructure metrics. I am also studying how to use Grafana for data visualization._

### Interests
My current goals are to dive deeper into DevOps tools and integrate them into my projects. I also started learning Node.js to expand my skills in backend development. Additionally, I have developed an interest in CTF (Capture the Flag) competitions, which helps me grow in the field of cybersecurity.
